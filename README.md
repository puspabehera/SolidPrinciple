# SolidPrinciple
 ## 🧱 Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

### 🔹 Definition
> **A class should have only one reason to change** — this means it should have only one responsibility.

---

### ❌ SRP Violation Example

```csharp
public class Report
{
    public void GenerateReport() { }
    public void SaveToDataBase() { }
    public void SendEmail() { }
}
Note: Report class have  Business logic: GenerateReport(),Persistence logic: SaveToDataBase(),Communication logic: SendEmail()

Each of these responsibilities can change for different reasons:Business rules for report generation may change.
DB layer structure/schema or repository pattern might evolve.
Email formatting or SMTP configuration might need changes.

👉 One class, multiple reasons to change = SRP violation.

### Real World Example

```csharp

🏨 The Scenario:
Imagine a restaurant.

There are:

A Chef 👨‍🍳 whose only job is to cook the food.

A Waiter 🧑‍💼 whose only job is to serve the food to the customer.

Now picture this:

What if the chef is also responsible for cooking, serving, and cleaning the tables?

That chef will:

Burn the food while running to serve it 🍳➡️🏃

Forget the order sequence

Get stressed out

Be hard to replace or train

❌ Code That Violates SRP
csharp
Copy
Edit
public class RestaurantStaff
{
    public void CookFood() { }
    public void ServeFood() { }
    public void CleanTable() { }
}
🔥 This RestaurantStaff class is like one person doing all jobs — chef + waiter + cleaner.
If cooking logic changes, or cleaning process updates, this single class has to change.
Too many reasons to change = SRP violation.
